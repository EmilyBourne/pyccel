This bot reacts to all comments which begin with `/bot`. This phrase can be followed by any of these commands:
- `show tests` : Lists the tests which can be triggered
- `run X` : Triggers the test X (acceptable values for X can be seen using `show tests`). Multiple tests can be specified separated by spaces.
- `try V X` : Triggers the test X (acceptable values for X can be seen using `show tests`) using python version V. Only one test can be run at a time.
- `mark as ready` : Adds the appropriate review flag and requests reviews. This command should be used when the PR is first ready for review, or when a review has been answered.
- `commands` : Shows this list detailing all the commands which are understood.
- `trust user` : Tells the bot that a new user is trusted to run workflows (prevents misuse of GitHub actions for mining etc). This command can only be used by a trusted reviewer.
